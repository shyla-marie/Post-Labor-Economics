## Abstract

This paper presents a rigorous macroeconomic analysis demonstrating that exponential technological advancements---in particular, breakthroughs in computational efficiency, algorithmic innovation, 
and labor automation---drive production prices asymptotically toward zero. By extending a dynamic, technology-adjusted Cobb-Douglas framework, we integrate stochastic automation processes with the 
effects of Baumolâ€™s cost disease to show that declining marginal costs undermine traditional price mechanisms. Our theoretical findings, supported by simulation evidence and situated within recent 
literature on AI-driven productivity, labor substitution, and digital deflation, suggest that an era of abundant, nearly free goods is on the horizon. This shift necessitates novel frameworks for 
resource allocation and income distribution in a post-labor or post--scarcity economy. <br>

**Keywords: Technological Innovation, Labor Automation, Post-Scarcity Economy.**
